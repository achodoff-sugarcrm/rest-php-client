# SugarCRM REST PHP Client

## Overview
A simple and intuitive Library for accessing a Sugar 7's REST v10 API. Allows for Object Oriented design around accessing data from a SugarCRM system, so you can easily get your integration project underway.

## Usage
Add to any project using composer:
```
"require": {
    "sugarcrm/rest-php-client": "~3.0"
}
```
> If you were previously using v1.x, please note v3.x uses different namespaces and design and is not backwards compatible. 
> You can run v1.x and v2.x side-by-side by using the sugarcrm/php-rest-client-v3 package, which will always maintain the latest 3.x package
